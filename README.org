A Discord bot designed to allow users to tag certain messages with special
emoji; these emoji are read by the bot and send a message with all the missed
messages when they come online.

* Acknowledgments

This bot would not be possible without Josh's excellent [[https://github.com/IGJoshua/discljord][discljord]] library.
